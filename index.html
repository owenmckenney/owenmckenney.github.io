            Hey there, I am Owen and I'm a 4th year undergraduate researcher at the 
            <a href="https://engineering.virginia.edu/department/mechanical-and-aerospace-engineering">
              University of Virginia
            </a>,
            where I am pursuing a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. 
            I am orginially from Charlottesville, Virginia and have spent much of my time at UVA conducting research in the bio-inspired robotics field. I aim to pursue a PhD where I can continue to conduct meaningful research in the novel robotics field, with an emphasis on bio-inspired robotic design and control. 
    
            I currently conduct research at the Bio-Inspired Engineering Research Lab (BIER lab) under the direction of <a href="https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/hilary-bart-smith">Dr. Hilary Bart-Smith</a> and Dr. Joseph Zhu. 
            I have been with the BIER Lab since Fall 2023, with my work mainly focusing on developing control strategies for bio-inspired swimming platforms. 
            I also had the opportunity to conduct research with the Sun Lab under the direction of <a href="https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/ye-sarah-sun">Dr. Sarah Sun</a> during Spring 2025, where I built a simulation environment for motion planning for use in EEG-controlled robotic manipulation.

      <p><strong>The distinctions between scaling laws and curve fitting:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Derived from physical principles (Newton’s second law, Kutta–Joukowski, Euler–Bernoulli).</li>
        <li>Units are consistent across all terms.</li>
        <li>Each term has a clear physical meaning.</li>
        <li>Validity is independent of datasets.</li>
        <li>Valid in asymptotic conditions (e.g., zero thrust as amplitude/frequency → 0).</li>
