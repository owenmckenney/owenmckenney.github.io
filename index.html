            Hey there! I'm Owen, a 4th year undergraduate researcher at the 
            <a href="https://engineering.virginia.edu/department/mechanical-and-aerospace-engineering">
              University of Virginia
            </a>,
            where I am pursuing a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I am originally from Charlottesville, Virginia and have spent much of my time at UVA conducting research in the bio-inspired robotics field. I aim to pursue a PhD where I can continue to conduct research in the novel robotics field, with an emphasis on bio-inspired robotic design and control. 
            Outside of school, I spend a lot of my free time hiking and camping in the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/blri/learn/nature/mountains.htm">Blue Ridge Mountains</a> and honing my cooking skills.

      <h2>Research Experience and Interests</h2>
      <p>
        I currently conduct research under the direction of <a href="https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/hilary-bart-smith">Dr. Hilary Bart-Smith</a> and Dr. Joseph Zhu and have been doing so since Fall 2023. 
        My work here has mainly focused on developing control strategies for bio-inspired swimming platforms, including a significant amount of work with the lab's <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-3190/abb86d">Tunabot</a> and Mantabot robotic vehicles. 
        I also had the opportunity to conduct research under the direction of <a href="https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/ye-sarah-sun">Dr. Sarah Sun</a> during Spring 2025 where I built a simulation environment for motion planning for use in EEG-controlled robotic manipulation. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>I am actively searching for PhD programs and labs for the Fall/Winter 2025 application cycle! Specifically, I am interested in programs that would enable me to continue my work in the bio-inspired and novel robotics field.</strong> 
      </p>
      <p>
        I am very interested in the design and control of these bio-inspired systems and believe that manueverable, efficient, low-cost, novel robots will eventually become commonplace for navigating adverse environments and completing tasks not suited for traditional robotics. 
        I also think that the traditional robotics space has a lot to learn from bio-inspired design, particulary when it comes to efficient locomotion and grasping. 
        I hope to be able to make contributions in this space through intelligent mechanical design and software control.
